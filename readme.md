# expect

A minimal Go utility for line-by-line assertion testing.
Reads lines from standard input and compares each to the corresponding expected value provided as command-line arguments.
Useful for simple test scripts and shell pipelines.

## Usage

```sh
printf "foo\nbar\n" | ./expect foo bar
```

- For each line of input, `expect` compares it to the corresponding argument.
- If a line does not match, an error is printed to stderr.
- The program exits with the number of failed comparisons as the exit code.
- If there is no input, it exits with code 128.

## Example

```sh
$ printf "hello\nworld\n" | ./expect hello world
$ echo $?
0

$ printf "hello\nthere\n" | ./expect hello world
expected: 'world'
  actual: 'there'

$ echo $?
1
```
